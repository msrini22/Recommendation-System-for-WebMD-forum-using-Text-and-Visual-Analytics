  document.getElementById("Test").innerHTML="<h3>Do breastfed babies have fewer behavioral problems later on in life?</h3> <p>Babies who were breast-fed until at least four months of age had fewer behavioral problems reported by their parents at five years of life. Thats the conclusion of a July, 2011 study published in Archives of Diseases of Childhood . Investigators reviewed data from about 9500 babies, born at term. At nine months of age, their parents completed a survey about feeding practices. Then, when the children grew to 5 years of age, a questionnaire was completed to find out which children had behavior problems (as judged by their parents.) Babies whose parents recalled nursing for at least four months were about a third less likely to have conduct or emotional problems. The study gives us yet another good reason to encourage nursing, but it also illustrates some interesting limitations of these sorts of looking backward, or retrospective studies. We dont know, actually, if the nursing caused the protection against behavior problems  perhaps there was some other factor at play. For instance, perhaps babies who were fussy and demanding were less likely to be successfully nursed, and those babies went on to be more likely to have behavior problems when they were older. In that case, though the lack of nursing and later problems are correlated, theyre not causal. Also, we dont have any way to separate the chemical or nutritional aspects of nursing with the attachment and process of nursing. Is it the milk itself, or the way the babies were held to nurse, or other differences in the way nursing and bottle-feeding mothers respond to their babies needs? Though we dont know exactly how nursing could help prevent behavior problems based on this study, it does seem to be another potential benefit to add to the overwhelming evidence that for almost all babies, breast is best.</p><h3>What neurological effects can happen to a baby that received to much ether at birth. the mother was 28. In 1961? </h3><p class='post-message'> Either used as a general anesthetic during childbirth sometimes resulted in side effects. Either is a caustic drug that may cause cellular starvation and damage to body organs. These negative side effects were pretty much limited to the mother and included nausea, organ damage, diabetic symptoms, stupor, difficulty in awakening and even death. My research of neurological or long tern side- effects to the baby yields no results in the form of medical studies. Babies often experienced breathing difficulties, sucking difficulties, and poor muscle tone after the use of general anesthetics. </p><h3>What effect can Wellbutrin have while my wife and I are trying to conceive and on the baby while it is breastfeeding? </h3><p class='post-message'>... You probably can relax so you can plan your child. We do not know of any real fetal anomalies that occur because the male takes the medication. Remember the medication will only be on the sperm (if any) and it will not affect breast feeding or any other issue with the baby. Wellbutrin we use for mothers during and after pregnancy. The biggest issue you need to understand, if you have depression, we believe it may be passed to your child. It may be passed in a dominant fashion so 50% of your children may be affected by depression. Knowing this may help you identify the problem early so they can be seen and treated.</p><h3>Are mother's drug tested when they give birth to a baby? </h3><p class='post-message'>If there is a reason for them to be yes.

      document.getElementById("Test").innerHTML="<h3> I have on going abdominal pain, what could it be?</h3><p>I would keep a food diary and see what foods make these symptoms worse. It sounds like a food allergy if you are getting headaches. You may want to ask a pharmacist to see if these are side effects of the contraceptive. Sharp stabbing pains can be gas pains. I would avoid or reduce intake of inflammatory foods such as anything deep fried, any refined sugar or wheat products, and dairy products. I have been on an anti-inflammatory diet lately and have kept a food diary. I found out that I have a problem with almonds as well as corn and that it is best for me to keep cheese consumption to a minimum (probably because it is inflammatory). Good foods to eat would include fruits and veggies, fish, avocados (which have anti-inflammatory effects), lentils, and foods that have not been highly processed. Taking probiotics may also help. Keep your blood sugar balanced as much as possible. This will help with the shakes. So will the diet and probiotics, as it will help your body absorb more nutrition. As far as the cramps go, I think that the contraceptive may be playing a big part in that. getting more exercise when you feel well enough to do it may help. I don't really know what to tell you about that. I don't think the two are related. When you have kept your food diary for a few weeks or month (s), it would be a good idea to discuss it with a doctor. They may order some tests or they may be able to give even better advice. You may want to discuss the contraceptive first and then go back with the food diary and have a follow-up with that. </p><h3> I had an abortion about a year ago, and ever since, I have experienced extreme vomiting at the start of every period.</h3><p> Hi I think this should shed some answers on your problem. The hormones created by the body during pregnancy can cause nausea and vomiting in and of themselves. The abortion causes the body to stop making these hormones very rapidly, and this throws the body out of rhythm hormonally. This sudden cessation of pregnancy hormones can cause nausea with or without vomiting and may last a few days. If vomiting becomes severe or persists, dehydration may result. Dehydration can lead to serious health complications, including death, so medical treatment becomes necessary for excessive vomiting. This was from www.livestrong.com So from this sounds like you need a blood test for your hormones, there have got out of whack, start with your doctor and work out from there. Do hope this helps. Good Luck </p><h3> I am 26 Fem.i have outburst of acne mostly on my red cheek,bad hairfall,constipation and irresular period.Please suggest </h3><p> Hi Get yourself to your doctor, from all what you say your a good candidate for the birth control pill, from what you saying, its the hormones in the pill that will get you well. Tell your doctor what you have told us, it should put a smile on his/her face. Do hope this helps you and in the future. Good Luck </p><h3> I had a baby two months ago and haven't got my first period is tha normal ? </h3><p> Yes, that can be normal, especially if you are nursing your baby. If you don't plan on getting pregnant this soon after a delivery (it happens), I would remind you that contraception is important. </p> <h3> Is Tart Cherry Juice effective in treating back pain? </h3> <p>  Nohard, thank you for your answer. Your suggested article was interesting and appreciated. I had read that Tart Cherry Juice (specifically) contains anti-inflammatory properties which helps with nerve control, may improve gout symptoms, and protects against muscle damage and the development of arthritis. I'm taking a leap of hope that some WebMd posters may have tried Tart Cherry Juice and can report on their experiences. I 'm looking for some reliable accountings from our peers to either support or refute what I had read. The product is somewhat pricy, but worth it if is effective in treating back pain. </p> <h3> Do women's menstrual cycles fall in sync with each other? </h3> <p> What is menstrual synchrony? Loosely defined, menstrual synchrony means that womens cycles sync up so that roommates, dorm residents, bunk mates in the military, or mothers and daughters begin to adjust cycle lengths such that females begin to be on their periods at the same time. Some reported adjustments in cycles included: two days closer together over a four to six-month interval (McClintock, 1971) and a 1.4 day shortening (Stern & McClintock, 1998). This is not a dramatic change. What conditions would lead women to synchronize? There have been studies looking at many types of female proximity. Menstrual synchrony was reportedly identified among a variety of female groupings: college roommates (McClintock 1971), lesbian couples (Weller& Weller, 1992), roommates who are close friends (Weller, 1995), and sexually segregated Bedouin women (Weller & Weller, 1997). Yet menstrual synchrony was not found among: roommates who are not close friends (Weller, 1995), nor lesbian couples living together for an extended period of time. (Weller & Weller, 1998). As you can see, the same group of researchers were not able to duplicate findings of menstrual synchrony among groups that were very similar (e.g. lesbian couples were synchronized, whereas lesbian couples who had lived together a mean of three years were not synchronized). One postulated reason for this is that apparent synchrony is really just due to chance. Two of the most recent studies have strengthened the idea that the best condition for cycling together is chance. Kiomkiewicz and colleagues (2006) evaluated 99 women for five months and found no synchrony of menstruation. The longest study, lasting one full year, assessed 186 Chinese women living together in dorms (Schank & Yang, 2006). Again, no menstrual synchrony emerged. Why would it appear that women cycle together? Readers of this blog and members of our Womens Health Community are likely aware that womens cycles have variable lengths. A normal cycle length is considered to be anywhere between 21 and 35 days, and most menstrual flows last between five and seven days. Thus, in a group of women, it would not be uncommon for the bleeding days to coincide at some point. There is often variability in cycle lengths in the same woman. Women with missed or erratic ovulations likely have the most variability. Regular readers of our posts have surely seen the number of women who write with concern about their periods being a few days early or late. Community members may also remember reading posts about menstrual periods suddenly moving from the second week of the month to the third (or vice versa). Among the published studies of synchrony, there can be issues with choice of statistics or methods of study as well. For example, results could be influenced if a researcher did not have baseline data to identify erratically cycling women, included women using a hormonal form of birth control, or merely asked women about the first day of their last period (instead of having a written record). Within the past decade, one of the other explanations for contradictory findings between menstrual synchrony studies has been the ability to smell pheromones. A pheromone is a chemical substance excreted where the odor of the pheromone gives a subtle message to another member of the same species. In pigs, the male boars saliva has two pheromones which cause the receptive female pig to not evade his advances (Perry, 1980). The same two pheromones are present in human underarm secretions. One of these pheromones (5 alpha-androstenol) is purported to be linked to menstrual synchrony. But before you become concerned about your roommates sweaty gym clothes draped all over the room, consider the evidence presented by Jahanfar (2007). A group of 88 students sharing housing were checked for similar menstrual timing and the ability to smell 5 alpha-androstenol. Almost 60 percent of the women did have similar cycle patterns, but there was no association with the ability to smell the pheromone. Women cycling together over time is an idea I would really like to believe, but the studies (even by the same researchers) are not very consistent. Perhaps we are actually better off if roommates are not having their own PMS stress-outs at the same time! </p>"

      document.getElementById("Test").innerHTML="<h3> What do I need to know about my egg supply when considering pregnancy? </h3><p> Understanding your egg supply, both origins and ways in which egg number declines, can help you to decide your next steps on the pathway to parenthood. Women have their lifetime supply of eggs when they are babies inside their mother. Eggs are a time-limited and time-released supply: time-limited because all women will someday go through menopause, and time-released because each month only a small group of eggs gain the ability to compete to ovulate. As egg number declines with aging, the group of eggs competing to ovulate each month gets smaller. With a smaller group of eggs competing each month, women tend to ovulate sooner and have fewer days between periods. Eventually there are periods of time where an egg is not available, and women will start skipping periods. Eventually there is not an egg available to ovulate, and a woman will no longer have periods. Fertility testing includes tests for egg number and egg release. Test of egg number include FSH (follicle stimulating hormone) and AMH (antimullerian hormone). FSH is the hormone that pushes eggs to move toward ovulation. When egg supply is low, FSH goes up. FSH is high in menopause. AMH is made by eggs at an earlier stage in their journey toward ovulation. AMH is higher in women with more eggs and lower in women with fewer eggs. AMH is undetectable in menopause. Tests of egg release include progesterone. Progesterone is a hormone that is made by the ovary after ovulation. If a woman has an elevated progesterone one week before her period, she is ovulating. If she does not, she needs to see her doctor to find out why she is not ovulating. The group of eggs that have the ability to ovulate will only compete if they receive the correct signals. A physician will test hormone levels and make the necessary adjustments to induce ovulation. Egg number tests like AMH and FSH predict how well you will respond to fertility drugs, because they reflect the number of eggs competing to ovulate. If FSH is high and AMH is low, a woman does not have many 'extra eggs' to respond to medication. If she has regular menstrual cycles with a progesterone proving ovulation, she is getting at least one egg out. If we try fertility medications and still get only one egg, fertility drugs are not helping to improve chances of pregnancy. As long as she continues to ovulate, she has a chance for pregnancy. If she wants to improve her chances after fertility drugs with her own eggs are not helping to increase the number of eggs released, she can consider using donated eggs. One percent of women will go through premature ovarian failure (before age 40). A reproductive endocrinologist will test to see why egg number declined early and test to see if other glands (thyroid, parathyroid, pancreas, adrenal) are showing signs of low hormone production. Women with POF have a 5-10% lifetime chance of pregnancy if an egg remaining in the ovary gains the ability to ovulate, ovulates, and meets with sperm. Currently there is no way to know when or if this post-ovarian failure ovulation will occur. Hearing that egg number is low can be devastating. A second opinion can help increase comfort with the diagnosis. A reproductive psychologist can help to discuss the feelings that arise. Egg donation, embryo donation, and adoption can help women with ovarian failure to build their family. </p><h3> What are some pregnancy symptoms? </h3><p> Once we decide we're ready to be pregnant, most of us are ready to be pregnant NOW. Suddenly we're much more aware of our cycles and our bodies. We chart our ovulation carefully, we time our BD, and then we wait  which is the hardest part. We watch for any symptoms that might indicate pregnancy, and with every pang or every woozy feeling we think, 'Is that a symptom??' To talk a little about the science of symptoms Most current pregnancy tests are based on the presence of a chemical called human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG). Although this chemical is present very early, the pregnancy has to connect with your blood system before it can be detected and before you would expect your body to have any symptoms of pregnancy. This connection is made with implantation, which occurs 8-10 days after conception. So symptoms (and a positive pregnancy test) might occur a few days before you actually miss your period. Breast changes: There can be a dramatic increase in breast volume early in pregnancy resulting in breast tenderness, tingling or noticeable increase in size. This symptom can happen days before you miss your period. Nausea and vomiting: This symptom tends to happen a little later than the breast changes but definitely in the first trimester. It generally happens around the time of your missed period or slightly later (4-6 weeks pregnant) and resolves around 14-16 weeks of your pregnancy. It has been called morning sickness but actually is present throughout the day. Fatigue: It can be dramatic through the first trimester but doesn't usually show up before you've missed your period. Pelvic cramping: Many women complain of cramping in early pregnancy. They usually describe it as feeling 'like my period is about to start.' It can last for weeks but usually remains more of a background nuisance discomfort than real pain. Although it is a very common normal symptom, you should discuss any pelvic pain in early pregnancy with your physician because it can sometimes be a warning sign of a dangerous medical condition. Bleeding: This is a scary one! Many normal pregnancies can have light bleeding with implantation. But when you tell us about bleeding, we're worried about the same thing you're worried about, could this be a miscarriage. Fortunately we can usually sort things out fairly quickly and put everyone's mind at ease. Although it's a very common, normal symptom, it's another symptom that is sometimes a warning sign of a dangerous medical condition so be sure to tell your physician about any unexpected bleeding. Of all of the symptoms listed above, breast changes are really the only symptoms that usually occur before you've missed a period. But, of course, as human beings, we have not only the science of symptoms to consider, but the emotional component as well  after all, deciding to get pregnant is an emotional decision. So, the tricky part for most women is that we can sometimes experience some of these symptoms  or think we are experiencing the symptoms  but we're NOT pregnant at all. Quite an emotional rollercoaster to ride month after month! **To re-emphasize: the symptoms listed above can be symptoms of pregnancy, but they can also be symptoms of other medical conditions  please see your doctor if you experience these symptoms.** </p><h3> Hello, I've recently been diagnosed with HEP C. I am experiencing mod-severe pain in my back, right side, is this normal </h3><p> Alone,the two conditions listed in your question (pregnancy and hepatitis c) leave a lot of possible explanations for your pain. Because you have been diagnosed with hepatitis, it is a natural inclination to think of the liver when experiencing right sided pain in the back ( and it could be related to the liver ). But many other system disorders could be also be the cause of your pain. I'll list some possible non- gynecological reasons first: Infections of various kinds and too numerous to list, Upper urinary tract obstruction, Gastro-intestinal issues, Thyroid disorders, Anxiety, Lyme Disease Heart & lung irregularities, Other causes. Gynecological reasons may include: Endometriosis, Pelvic congestion, Pelvic Inflammatory Disease, Pre-term labor and delivery, Miscarriage, Pelvic organ prolapse, Other causes. As you can see, the possible causes for your pain covers a lot of territory. The reasons cited above are only a small sampling of all possible causes. The best way to determine the root cause of your pain is to visit a doctor . Are you receiving pre-natal care? A physician can look at your medical history, ask questions, perform a physical exam, order basic diagnosing tests, and refer you to specialists. For your sake and your unborn baby's sake, I recommend that you quickly visit your family doctor, your ob/gync doctor, or hepatic specialist to obtain medical care. It may be true, as stated in your question, that you cannot receive treatment until after the baby is born. But that fact should not deter you from being evaluated by a medical professional. If you do not have medical insurance to be evaluated, most state governments provide for the free health screenings of pregnant women though the department of welfare. There are also many free women's clinics. You may also want to explore eligibility for The Women's, Infants, and Children program, WIC. Under WIC, free food is provided to eligible applicants. </p><h3> What kind of complications does shingles cause during pregnancy? </h3> <p> Shingles can be quite painful. Many people who see their doctor for shingles say it was the pain that ultimately led them to seek treatment. Some report that the sensation of anything brushing across the inflamed nerve endings on the skin is almost unbearable. Even when the rash is gone, postherpetic neuralgia can persist, sometimes for years. Shingles can cause other lasting complications as well. If it occurs on the face, it can damage your eyes. Shingles of the eye can lead to scarring, which can damage your vision. It can also lead to glaucoma, an eye disease that can cause blindness later in life. Shingles can also cause hearing or balance problems as well as weakness of the muscles on the affected side of the face. In rare cases, shingles can spread into the brain or spinal cord and cause serious complications such as stroke or meningitis (an infection of the membranes outside the brain and spinal cord). According to the CDC, more than one-third of people who get shingles will develop serious complications. People whose immune systems are suppressed because of medication or diseases such as HIV run the greatest risk of complications. Complications are also more common among people over age 60, which precludes women of childbearing age. Nevertheless, if a shingles outbreak affects your eye or you notice any symptoms outside of the area of the outbreak, you should speak to your doctor right away. The incidence of shingles in pregnant women is very low. If you are planning to get pregnant and are concerned about shingles, speak to your doctor about the possibility of the shingles vaccine. If you are already pregnant, practice healthy habits and let your doctor know if you have any symptoms. Early recognition and treatment will minimize the risk of complications for you and your baby. </p><h3> What vitamins are safe to use during pregnancy and which should be avoided? </h3><p> I get asked all the time as a pharmacist about vitamin supplements and other items. Come and talk to the pharmacist first. In most cases, the pharmacist is going to ask you if you are seeing a doctor or OB/GYN. Most likely, they are going to put you on a prescription vitamin. There are specific formulations made just for pregnant women. They cover a good amount of the vitamins, and also include things like iron, calcium, and folic acid. These are very important and not only for the mom. But for the baby as well and help in development of their spine and their brain, so really important that pregnant moms understand that they need to get special vitamins made just for them. Now you want to be careful and make sure that while you are taking these prenatal vitamins that you are not taking additional vitamins on top of it. You could actually take too much of certain vitamins and that may cause some problems down the road. So let your pharmacist know everything that you are taking including over-the-counter herbal and vitamins. The herbal category is an area that I would definitely avoid while you are pregnant. We just don't have any studies or data to know whether or not it's going to harm mom or baby. So better to be safe than sorry. As far as medications over-the-counters, come and ask the pharmacist. If you have certain things like an upset stomach there are some products that are available and can be used in pregnant women, but you really need to talk to us first. As far as prescription medications, there are many different products that a pregnant mom can take and by the pharmacist and physician or healthcare provider working together. We can make sure that you are on the right ones. Once again, if you have any questions, come and talk to us with the medication experts. </p>"

      document.getElementById("Test").innerHTML="<h3> What medications can I talk to my pain management doctor about to help with my sciatica and constant migraines? </h3><p> Courtney: Let's answer your opening question honestly and directly.The pain management doctor probably doesn't want to talk with you about medications. You could discuss hydrocodone, but will most likely be dismissed. There is a reluctance by most pain management doctors to prescribe pain relief medication due to potential law suits (Yes, some patients actually sue the doctor and win for causing a drug addiction), unscrupulous patients who are actively addicted, or those scoundrels who will sell the drugs. My orthopedic doctor referred me to a pain management physician.for severe sciatic type pain and lower back pain. A bulging disc was confirmed through MRI studies at L and S1. During my first pain management visit I was given a spinal injection of cortisone. The doctor told me that it might not work so upon leaving the office I asked the R.N. if there was something else that could be prescribed if the procedure failed. She flippantly told me to take an Advil as the practice didn't prescribe medicine and that narcotics would not work on nerve pain. What an uncaring, incompetent statement by a registered nurse, or more likely it was just an outright lie. On the 2nd visit I underwent a spinal epidural process. Both treatment modalities failed miserably and left me in excoriating pain. I tried physical therapy, ice packs, a heating pad, motion 800 mg 4x's a day, and slept on an 18 wooden board without relief. I returned to my orthopedic surgeon who prescribed hydrocodone 5 w/325 Tylenol. Taking three pills at bedtime actually helps. Additionally he scheduled me to see an orthopedic surgeon (at the first available appointment during the end of August 2014) to evaluate my condition for surgical consideration. I am relating my story to confirm the facts outlined in your question. In 2014 many doctors are fearful of prescribing narcotic medications to a 24 year old person, or even a 65 year old person. Something needs to change in the practice of pain management. Doctors take a sacred oath to do no harm. I suggest that sending a patient away in severe pain without an adequate treatment pain is causing harm and goes against the principles and spirit of causing no harm. I suggest that you find a doctor willing to treat your pain with medication sufficient to relieve the pain. At the same time seek out a cause for your pain and have the appropriate treatment completed to resolve your condition without continuing to take pain medication . No LEGITIMATE pain suffer should be forced to jump out of their skin, cry in agony, or find a drug supplier on the street. There are surgical remedies, acupuncture, and implanted pain control pumps to alleviate even the most torturous pain.</p><h3> can physicians recommend a patient to take medication prescribed by another physican that they happen to have at home? </h3><p> My response is intended to be helpful and offered with respect. I would never protect the actions of a rouge doctor or support an inappropriate medical decision. In my opinion, this doctor did not cross any ethical or legal lines. If you were appalled, why didn't you question this action when it was made? The doctor could have immediately answered your question and explained their reasoning, but wasn't given an opportunity. You suggest in your question that the doctor should have prescribed something for pain. Well that's exactly what happened; the oxycodone still in your mother's possession is used as an agent to control pain. Would you have felt better if the doctor had written a new prescription for oxycodone? How did the doctor know that your mother still had oxycodone remaining from her dental treatment? That information must have been volunteered by the patient. Upon learning that your mother already had pain medication available, why not use it? As long as the oxycodone was originally prescribed for your mother and had not reached its expiration date, the doctor's action was acceptable. Perhaps the doctor wanted to save your mother time in waiting at the pharmacy or wanted to save her some money. I can only guess the reasons for his decision. In summary, doctors are licensed to prescribe medications in various fashions. These may include suggesting over-the-counter drugs, providing the patient with factory packaged free-sample drugs, loose free-sample medications placed in a bag with dosing instructions, hand writing a new prescription for pharmacy dispensing, directing office staff to administer medications, provide over the phone orders to the pharmacy, email and fax prescriptions sent directly to the pharmacy, and even advising a patient to resume medications previously prescribed by another doctor. They even have the authority to prescribe medications for conditions that were not intended or approved to be treated with that drug. This practice is referred to as 'Off-Label Prescribing'. For example some anti-seizure medications are also prescribed to treat pain. Mixed in with those prescription authorization practices and customs is the necessity to determine who really requires pain medications and who are the individuals that may be manipulating the system in order to feed a drug addiction or to make some 'street money'. Doctors have awesome powers and responsibilities in properly prescribing medications. They spent years studying anatomy/physiology, chemistry, biology, disease processes, and pharmacology. They are keenly aware of approaches used to control pain and must first do no harm. </p> <h3> Lower back pain and in the back of my thighs and butt? </h3> <p> It could be Sciatica although the pain may be more intense while lying down and sitting with that condition. Does the pain extend down to your ankles and feet? If so, this is suggestive of a Sciatic Nerve disorder. Back pain resulting from disc bulging, pinched nerves, muscle pulls, other medical conditions (such as growth masses) , bone fractures, and narrowing of the spinal column (stenosis) are other possibilities. I suggest that you make an appointment to be evaluated by a primary care doctor. This individual may review your medical history, interview you for the pain quality, exact location of your pain, pain level, flush-out possible traumatic events that may have occurred, prescribe medications including analgesics and anti-inflammatory non-steroidal drugs,conduct blood and urine lab work & get the ball rolling with a radiographic x-ray. This doctor may also refer you to other medical specialists. In summary: Lower back pain costs the American Economy large amounts of money in medical expenses, lost work hours, worker compensation claims, doctor office visits, and intense pain experienced by the patient. This type of symptomology requires resolution beginning first with a clear diagnosis. Once a diagnosis is established, treatment efforts may be started moving from conservation forms like cortisone injections, analgesics, bed rest, pillows placed under the knees, chiropractic treatments, and ice and heat treatments. Although these symptoms sometimes may virtually spontaneously improve (in conjunction with some conservative efforts), more aggressive testing like MRI's and surgical intervention is frequently necessary. It can take a lengthily time to achieve relief (months or even years). I wish that the process was less cumbersome and more patient friendly.Unfortunately, medical insurance companies through their 'bean-counting' policies (directed at cost saving) make most of the bigger treatment/testing decisions today.The physician many time finds that their decisions are overturned by some HMO clerk following a complicated reimbursement and procedure manual. These sometimes uncaring and reckless institutional decisions can delay diagnosis and the starting of treatment efforts. Hopefully a cause for your symptoms will rapidly be determined, but please don't count on any quick fix. Best wishes for your health improvement. </p> <h3> Why would a Dr insist on prescribing percocet 10-325 over oxycodone 10mg It makes me nauseaus, and he doesnt believe me. </h3> <p> I think one of the most frustrating things in the field of medicine is the overall feeling by Physicians that all patients are created equal. They consistently confuse the patient rights with the Bill of Rights, oh, but if they would only learn. I started a few years ago to be my strongest, most vocal, most knowledgeable, most interested advocate of them all when it came to my health care. It is my body, my mind, and nobody, I mean nobody knows it nor should they better than I. If I can go to an appt. prepared with questions, about what I think might be wrong, and have a discussion, I feel alot better than it being a crap shoot. Two years ago, if it hadn't been for me and Web MD I swear my doctor would have killed me. If you can't take the medication with throwing up, switch doctors, if he is new doctor, provide previous records. If he won't listen to reason, report him. If you are on the up and up about NOT being able to take the Tylonol, then you are allergic. and the answer of ,'because that's the way we do it, is not treating the patient under the oath that doctor has taken. So you have to make a choice. Take the meds he gives you, change doctors, or you can report to the States Insurance Comm. for not providing adequate care, file it and see what happens. If you're abusing the opiates and he knows it,well then you answered your own question quite honestly. I worked for a pain mgt. physician in Daytona Beach some years back, and I got to know the patients very well. I liked them alot, but my eyes were not Eyes Wide Shut. If he has your current records if he is a new doctor, with those and learning more about who you are as a patient and a person he may come around,. I have doctor do that to me even with something like nausea meds. I was told what I was taking was making me to sleepy. I had been taking it for several years, it had yet ever to make me sleepy. I told the doctor, drugs like this that are suppose to have that affect don't on me, their fine. She didn't prescribe them, gave me another drug, that didn't work, and made me sick to my stomach.. and I told her that nicely but it was true. Listen to your patients...

My experience with this type of pain could be one of a few things, i will list them and then explain below... -too much fresh fruit and veggies -not enough water in her diet*** -Celiac disease -dairy sensitivity*** -crohns disease -Your doctor can test her for celiac or you really you can do it on your own if you are to the point that you are fed up with doctors. Celiacs are on a Gluten Free diet, nothing with gluten whatsoever and that includes alot of things that you wouldnt think have the so called 'no no' ingredients in them so I would research gluten free diets just to be sure. -I'm not really sure what crohns disease consists of, however ive had friends that have it and experience the same thing your daughter is going through, here is a website you can look at for that, that they referred me too. http:/www.crohnsandcolitisinfo.com/?cid=ppc_ppd_ggl_crohns_da_ccinfo_non-tv_crohn%27s_disease_Phrase -My nephew had dairy sensitivity, and it cause these issues as well. If she is an avid milk drinker I would consider lowering the fat content of the milk for a while, for instance if you have her on whole milk go to 2% that kind of thing. And limit her other dairy intake for a while, butter, yogurt, cheese, etc...if it helps some just by reducing these things then you know its a dairy issue and i would switch her to soy milk, rice milk, or something of the sort and stop the cheese alltogether. -believe it or not, not enough water in her diet can cause these issues as well, they could be anything from sever pain to constipation, or a mixture of the two. I have had this issue myself. the correct amount of water to have is 8 8oz. glasses in a 24 hour period if you cant get her to drink it, dry using the new koolaid liquid drink mixers or crystal light something of the sort. just be sure whatever you mix with the water does not contain aspartame as this is poisonous for the human body if given too much over a long period of time. -last but not least, too many fresh fruits and veggies can cause severe gas build up which can lead to pain and constipation as well. try sticking to the food guide pyramid with this though, you can look it up online to suit her age and weight and everything as to how much she should have. These are all from personal experience or from close friends and family that have had these issues. I hope this helps. </p>"

      document.getElementById("Test").innerHTML="<h3> What is the treatment for cold sores, are there any home remedies, and what medications are used?</h3><p> Currently, there are no cures or vaccines for the herpes simplex virus. However, avoiding precipitating factors, such as sunburn and stress, can help prevent additional outbreaks. There are established treatments available to help decrease healing time, reduce pain associated with the lesion, and in specific cases, suppress the recurrence of the virus. Nondrug therapy: Frequent hand washing will help reduce the spread of the virus to other parts of the body or to other people. Also, applying cool, moist compresses to the lesion may decrease pain and keep the lesion from drying and cracking. Over-the-counter (OTC) topical medications: Most topical OTC products provide symptomatic relief only; they do not decrease healing time. Using topical anesthetics that contain benzocaine (5%-20%), lidocaine (0.5%-4%), tetracaine (2%), or dibucaine (0.25%-1%) will help relieve burning, itching, and pain. The most commonly recommended products are Lipactin gel and Zilactin. It is important to keep in mind that these topical anesthetics have a short duration of action, usually only lasting 20-30 minutes. Skin protectants, such as allantoin, petrolatum, and dimethicone-containing products help keep the lesion moist and prevent cracking of the lesion. Sunscreen-containing lip balms may also help prevent additional outbreaks if the sun is a precipitating factor. For additional pain relief, using aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil), or acetaminophen (Tylenol) may be beneficial. These products should be used according to package directions. Docosanol 10% cream (Abreva) is the only OTC topical product that is known to decrease healing time when applied at the first sign of recurrence (for example, the prodrome or tingling sensation). Docosanol is applied five times per day until the lesion is healed. Common side effects include rash and itching at the site of application. Prescription-strength topical medications: Treatment with topical acyclovir (Zovirax 5% cream) or penciclovir (Denavir 1% cream) will reduce healing time by approximately half a day and decrease pain associated with the lesion. Topical treatment is limited in its effectiveness because it has poor penetration to the site of replication of the virus, and therefore is restricted in its healing ability. Acyclovir cream should be applied five times per day for four days, and penciclovir cream should be applied every two hours while awake for four days. In August 2009, the FDA approved a cream containing acyclovir and a topical steroid, which reduces healing time by approximately one day. Oral prescription-strength medications: The current FDA-approved oral antiviral medications used in the treatment of herpes simplex virus in adults are acyclovir, valacyclovir (Valtrex), and famciclovir (Famvir). Famciclovir has not been tested in children with cold sores. These oral medications have been shown to decrease the duration of the outbreak, especially when started during the prodrome (symptom onset before the actual condition becomes fully evident). The medications are generally well tolerated with few side effects. Most common side effects include headache, nausea, and diarrhea. Treatment is only for one day with valacyclovir and famciclovir. Valacyclovir is given as 2 grams orally every 12 hours for one day, and famciclovir is given as 1,500 milligrams orally for one dose. Acyclovir is given as 400 mg orally five times per day for five days. Acyclovir, valacyclovir, and famciclovir are considered relatively safe and effective when used in pregnancy, although topical treatment would be preferred when appropriate. Acyclovir and valacyclovir have been used while breastfeeding. However, pregnant women and nursing mothers should contact their physician or pharmacist prior to using any medication. People who have more than two outbreaks in four months, which significantly affect their daily lives, should consider chronic suppressive therapy. The FDA has approved the use of oral valacyclovir daily to prevent recurrence of the herpes simplex virus in people with normal immune systems and famciclovir in people with suppressed immune systems. Other treatment options: Lysine supplements, citrus bioflavonoids, lactobacillus acidophilus and bulgaricus, and vitamins C, E, and B12 have also been identified in the potential treatment of herpes simplex virus. However, there is no good clinical evidence to support these treatments, and they are not recommended. </p><h3> I have psoriasis on my elbows. I don't want to use prescription medications. Can supplements help? </h3><p> Psoriasis is an autoimmune condition, and over the past 10-15 years. We have discovered the exact pathway that's gone awry, and so there are new treatments that we have for it that can target various points along that pathway, and these are called biologics, and they are prescription based medicines. In psoriasis, there is no diet or supplement that has been shown consistently to help treat the psoriasis. So there is nothing out there that you can really do. But psoriasis being an autoimmune condition tends to also be made worse by stress. So managing your stress can help. It won't cure the psoriasis, but it can help you have better control over it. Other products we use are just moisturizers and even just occlusion. So just having something cover the area and add water in, and maybe even a little bit of sunlight along with that, can help suppress the psoriasis in that area, but it isn't a cure. So what the sunlight does that helps the psoriasis is that it suppresses the immune system in the skin, and that's what turns it off. But in the winter it tends to come back, and of course you have to be careful not to get too much sun and a sunburn, because then you end up with other problems that can be much worse. </p><h3>why does my cosmetic surgeon need to know if I use drugs? </h3><p> We ask the patient to tell us everything that we believe is important for their safety. There are some drugs that people dont want to own up to. There are people who, for example have taken cocaine and its left some damage in the nose and we need to know what the damage came from We remind the patient though that this is confidential. It is, it does not go beyond the office, and does not go beyond the operating room, and it is up to the patient if they ever want any of that revealed, because they dont have to have their medical records released to anybody. There isnt a cop in the world that can demand your medical record. They can demand your drivers license, but nobody has the right to demand your medical records without your permission. So they are held in strict confidence. Its much more important that we know these things than that the patient, because we dont want the patient to worry that oh my god, I dont want anybody to know. Now we need to know for the patients safety. I could recount tragedies that occurred because the patients did not reveal to the anesthesiologist the history of drug abuse and that led to serious complications. Thats a story unto itself isnt it? Oh yeah, there are certain drugs that interact for example, very unfavorably with certain anesthetic agents. Thats the risk of not fessing up. Youve got to be honest with your doctor, your doctor needs to be honest with you about the risks of not being honest. </p><h3> What are the dangerous effects of drug use in teens? </h3> <p> Teens with drug abuse issues risk their health as well as their futures. Between the ages of 12 and 20, there are important physiological and psychological changes that occur. These changes can be significantly altered in teens that have drug abuse. Identifying the signs of drug abuse in your teen may save his or her life. Parents can help their teens by getting them help for the drug abuse and by helping them regain control of their life. There are some indications that could help you determine if your teen is using drugs. Have you noticed a decline in their grades at school, a change in their behavior and attitude or have they lost interest in things that at one time was important? Has your teen been noticeably tired or hyperactive? What about their friends, have you noticed that they are not hanging out with the same group? These are all things to consider if you suspect that your teen is using drugs. There are some valuable resources online at the Mayo Clinic, National Institute on Drug Abuse, and Teen Drug Abuse. Each of these sites offer tips on how to talk to your teen about drug abuse. Making yourself aware of what is going on with your teen is the best way to prepare to help them.

Heroin can be snorted, sniffed or injected. One of the factors that make the drug so dangerous is that it is often mixed with some pretty toxic chemicals such as rat poison, household cleaners including drain cleaner, as well as over-the-counter antihistamines and prescription painkillers including Fentanyl. Heroin abuse can result in chronic and severe health issues including kidney, liver, heart and brain damage, as well as pulmonary and respiratory issues. Heroin users are also at risk for developing Hepatitis, HIV and AIDS. Quitting Heroin can be very difficult, but it is not impossible. Do not try to quit on your own or cold turkey. Heroin withdrawal is quite painful and the side effects can turn into life threatening consequences without notice. During Heroin withdrawal you can expect to experience some or all of the following symptoms:  Flu-like symptoms   Nausea/vomiting   Cravings  Body/muscle aches/pains   Constipation/diarrhea   Restless legs/arms  Depression  Anxiety/irritability  Paranoia Most physicians recommend getting help quitting Heroin through a professional medical detox treatment.

      document.getElementById("Test").innerHTML="<h3> Can Chlamydia still show negative if sexual intercourse has only been 6 days that u believe you were infected? </h3><p> Yes, you can still have a negative Chlamydia test and potentially have Chlamydia . Much depends on the TYPE of test you took (urine or vaginal smear if you are female, or urine or urethral smear if you are male). Not knowing the details of your exposure, I am assuming that you had unprotected sex. Do you know for a fact if this person has Chlamydia or not? If you do know that you have been exposed, you can elect to be treated regardless of the test result. When in doubt, get re-tested and tested again sometime later. Fear of an STD can be eliminated or drastically reduced if you make sure you or your partner use condoms. </p><h3> How are sex and sleep related to diabetes? </h3><p> I dont know any doctors who prescribe sex to treat diabetes, but after hearing a recent lecture Im starting to wonder, Why not? Theres a general notion that sex is favorable to good health, but most doctors dont specifically encourage their patients to have more sex. Naturally, we dont want to encourage unprotected or unsafe sex associated with sexually transmitted diseases, or sex that leads to unwanted pregnancies. Also, we dont want to encourage reckless sex that leads to car accidents or dislocated hips or other unforeseen injuries, and the last thing we want is for someone to have a heart attack during sex and blame us for it. However, I cant think of a single patient I treat who is likely to have any of those bad outcomes from having more sex. Having a heart attack during sex is very rare, and, in fact, increased sexual frequency is associated with reduced risk of heart disease, and is encouraged after recovering from a heart attack. Sex is one form of exercise that most people like! Its good for the heart and circulation, and helps maintain good blood flow to the sex organs. Use it or lose it is a fair statement, particularly in older people and those with diabetes. Erectile dysfunction occurs in over half of men with diabetes, especially after several years of poor blood sugar control, and maintaining sexual frequency may potentially help delay or avoid erectile dysfunction. Not surprisingly, eating right and exercising can help partially reverse erectile dysfunction in men, by improving blood pressure, blood flow, body fat and hormone levels. Women with diabetes may also be at increased risk for sexual problems, and it stands to reason that maintaining an active sex life may help prevent such problems. Healthy sleep habits are very important for diabetes management  and sex and sleep are closely related, (enough to be considered bedfellows perhaps). Sex improves sleep, and vice versa. Similarly, problems with sleep can interfere with sex. Sex releases hormones that help promote sleep (especially in men), and sleep promotes hormones that favor good blood sugar control and appetite control. By the same token, inadequate sleep quality or quantity promotes hormones that worsen blood sugar control, appetite, weight gain, diabetes and heart disease. So here we have a cycle of gradually decreasing health, sleep and sex over time. As one aspect worsens, the others may too, on and on it goes. The shame of it is that people generally like sex and sleep and feeling good. Can we break the cycle? Is it as simple as turning off the TV an hour earlier and having more sex? Unfortunately, its not always so simple. Doctors are in a great position to help patients recognize and reverse this cycle, and should embrace the power of healthy sexuality to fight chronic illness, but most are not doing so. It is not because doctors are unaware of the health benefits of sex. It is not that doctors are afraid of the remote negative outcomes mentioned above. Doctors dont bring up sex because its so easy not to, and because patients dont typically bring it up on their own. This mirrors the reasons doctors and patients often dont bring up obesity and weight loss during the course of a routine health visit. Because visits are often rushed, the problem is not acute, there are lots of other priorities and starting the discussion seems risky. I know we can do much better. </p><h3> What are some ways that those with fibromyalgia can enjoy better sex and intimacy? </h3><p> I want to discuss strategies for trying to enjoy sex and intimacy more despite FM. ... Many tell me the effect of FM on sex is the biggest problem in a relationship. Call me old-fashioned, but if your partner is willing to be open-minded and adapt to the 'FM you,' I think love gets stronger and conquers all. ... Open Communication: This is the most important. Often couples are not comfortable, at first, having converstions about sex. Some find it embarrassing to speak freely. Perhaps a good starting point is connecting on the FM. Discuss FM and how it specifically interferes with your intimacy. Reaffirm that avoiding sex does not equal rejecting the partner. Progress the communication gradually and become more open in sharing each other's most intimate concerns and needs. Specific Solutions: Identify specfic barriers to your unique situation, and solve them if you can. If your main barrier is lack of libido/interest, then determine if it's from fear of pain, fatigue, depression, medicine side effects, disinterest in your partner, etc. Don't just assume it's the 'fibro' and nothing can be done. Your specific barrier 'list' can be treated, step by step, by adjusting/changing meds, modifying routines etc. to remove libido-lowering factors. Work with your health professionals, of course. Many times the process of simply recognizing the barriers and planning to address them results in a positive effect (placebo) and improves sexual mood. If pain during intercourse is a problem, try to ID the specific cause. ... Is it painful muscle spasms during sex? If so, consider a pre-sex routine to relax muscles.... Sometimes your doctor can prescribe certain meds to relax muscles and decrease tension to take an hour before sexual activity, i.e. a pre-emptive strike strategy. Painful pressure? Find positions with minimal pressure. If the problem is not pain but poor sexual organ responsiveness, try lubricants, stimulating creams/products, natural products, or talk with your doctor about prescribed sexual stimulant meds. I know these sound pretty basic and obvious, but many times couples do not try the obvious due to uncertainty if it's 'OK' to do something different. It's OK to do this. Re-discover the Romance: Intimacy is not the same as having sex and it doesn't only happen in the bedroom; intimacy occurs throughout the day. Couples can work on sending intimacy signals during the day: smiles, compliments, appreciative remarks, soft hugs etc. Try not to let FM stop these signals. Couples can also take more time to get ready. Yes, I'm talking about foreplay! Strive for natural and comfortable, including a comfortable environment free from drafts. Teach each other to rediscover touch with gentle stroking, massage, soft hugs, kissing, holding: NO poking, squeezing or playful slaps. Discover new rituals: warm oil massage, couple's hot tub, hot bath, or shower. Sexual activities other than intercourse can be explored and enjoyed. Find Comfortable Positions: We can figure this out. Experiment with different positions to minimize distracting painful pressure. ... Find out what works for you and it's OK to redefine what is 'traditional' for you. Be comfortable together. Professional Counseling: Sometimes this may be needed to work out ongoing concerns about sex and intimacy. You may wish to discuss this option with your FM doctor. ... </p> <h3> Can a girl get pregnant from precum the day after her period, then taking the morning after pill. </h3><p> The short answer is yes and no. Yes she can get pregnant from pre-cum and, no she cannot get pregnant the day or two after her period ends. The long answer is as follows:<?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office/><o:p></o:p> Using a condom and/or birth control will help keep your minds at ease and are likely your best method for not having an unwanted baby. Most health departments will offer both at little to no cost. If it is true that her period ended on Friday then it is highly unlikely that she will become pregnant, day after pill or not. Sperm can live for 24-72 hours in the female body. Most will die off en-route searching for an egg however it only takes one egg and one sperm. A woman's cycle works like this. Period starts and triggers a turn of events. The LH phase is the phase when her body is not fertile, typically 10-16 days from the day the period starts depending on her specific cycle. Then the fertile days come in to play. For about 4-5 days her body will be in a fertile state but typically it is the last two days of this particular cycle when she is most ready to get pregnant. Once this phase is over her body prepares to have another period to shed the lining that has built up to accept the pregnancy. I would suggest getting an app on her phone that tracks her cycle and her most fertile times of the month. Mostly because I don't see you two using a condom or birth control no matter how many people tell you that you should. At least this way you two will have a better understanding of where her body is at and when its at that point to try and keep from getting pregnant. It can take about three months to get the app lined up with her cycle to track the days with the most accuracy. Please keep in mind that this is for a woman with a 'normal' cycle however even with an abnormal cycle it is highly unlikely to get pregnant within a few days of ending a period. This information comes from personal experience with tracking my own cycle to achieve pregnancy which I have done successfully. Best of luck to you both! </p><h3> Painful sex after no sex for 3 years and after prolapse sugery </h3><p> Hi OK its like your back to squire one, I mean like when you were a virgin, things have just shrunk a bit.

      document.getElementById("Test").innerHTML="<h3> What can cause a skin rash? </h3> <p> There are many, many causes for a rash, but when one shows up in school, teachers assume the worst. They are worried about measles, chicken pox, Lyme disease, scarlet fever, Fifth disease, impetigo, herpes simplex/zoster, hand/foot/mouth disease, MRSA or roseola, just to name a few. It is this fear of imminent contagiousness that leads to the childs exclusion from school. Sometimes, the skin eruption is due to allergies, such as hives, or just a worsening dry-skin condition, like eczema (atopic dermatitis). Even a cold virus (whether its in a cold thats at the contagious stage or not) can cause a rash. Fortunately for all of us, most rashes that children get are not serious or contagious. I have seen children excluded for insect bites, hives, sunburns, poison oak/ivy, eczema, and even zits. Teachers are not dermatologists, so they are not going to make the diagnosis. The school is just going to exclude the child and require a clearance note before the child can return. I had a child excluded this week with poison oak. Poison oak is not contagious, but at least half of the people I encounter think that it is. The oleoresin of the Rhus plant is definitely contagious, but once this oil has been washed off of the contaminated skin, clothing and other objects, it can no longer cause trouble. When people see this ugly rash oozing, they assume the drainage is the poison. This is not true. Once the person takes a good shower and changes their clothes, they do not need to be treated like they have leprosy. High school wrestlers tend to get a variety of skin infections from those contaminated mats. I see common warts, molluscum (another wart-like skin lesion), impetigo (a staph or strep skin infection), and more recently, MRSA (a potentially serious, drug-resistant Staph infection). Of course, the wrestlers are also excluded from participation because of eczema, mosquito bites and other non-contagious skin issues. Referees and coaches are getting better in recognizing skin problems, I must say. Its not measles. I must say this statement a dozen times a week, contradicting home diagnoses made by day-care providers and grandmothers. Measles is relatively rare in the United States now. Personally, I have not seen a case in over 20 years, thanks to the effectiveness of vaccinations. A few hundred to a few thousand cases still occur in the U.S., depending on the year, in unvaccinated individuals. Mosquito and flea bites can mimic early chicken pox lesions, but only for a short while. Chicken pox (varicella) looks like a dew drop sitting on a rose petal. It is a tiny blister on a red base which turns into a scab, followed by a tiny crater (pox) in a day or so. Although varicella-immunized children can get a mild case, it really does look different than mosquito bites. Chicken pox is caused by the herpes virus, so re-exposure to this disease later in life can cause a reactivation of the virus resulting in herpes zoster, also known as shingles. Warts are contagious, but not very much. To exclude a child from school because of warts is really unnecessary. It can take a month or more to effectively treat a case of stubborn warts, freezing them with liquid nitrogen or chemically burning them with various acids. High school wrestlers with warts can wrestle as long as they are covered by clothing or a bandage, but many are excluded from participation by an eagle-eyed referee. </p><h3> What are some cheaper alternatives to plastic surgery for youthful skin? </h3><p> Yes, I am a facial cosmetic surgeon and still make patients happy with eyelid and facelifts, neck lifts and chemical wrinkle removal. But for those on a tighter budget, cosmetic surgeons and dermatologists can now give you some real bang for your non-surgical bucks. Here is my shortlist of the three best things you can do for that healthy, younger and youthful look: 1. Retin-A. Retin-A, a derivative of vitamin A, should be thought of as a vitamin too. The skins own potent and unique vitamin, if you will. Take one a day if you will. A nighttime application of just a pea-sized amount of Retin-A (available also as the generic retinoic acid) followed by application of a moisturizer (another favorite and winner; see below) will go a long way to make your skin smoother and free of minor blemishes including some of those nasty brown spots, age spots. An important long-term benefit of Retin-A is that it thickens the outer layer of the skin and thats important; thicker skin resists wrinkling. Retin-A is available only by prescription. It comes in various strengths. Consult your dermatologist or cosmetic plastic surgeon for more information and advice on use. And, remember, for the optimal results, use it every day; dont quit! 2. Moisturizer + sunscreen. Summers here -- we need to get serious about sun protection. Particularly if you live in Southern CA, South Texas or South Florida. In those hot spots, the sun is strong and therefore, not your skins best friend. There are many excellent moisturizer-sunscreen combinations on the market. And, dont equate cost with excellence. The pricier ones have the big ticket to pay for all the marketing and advertising. What SPF (sun protection factor) number should you use? The number scale was developed to indicate potency relative to elapsed time of use. Divide the SPF number by four to get the number of hours the product is expected to be effective. The only problem with such a general formula is that it does not take into account how heavy the application and what factors might cause the protection to be dissipated, such as by sweating or water sports. Best advice: Pick a mid-strength product, say SPF 30; reapply every 2-3 hours and you cannot go wrong. Remember, a little sun is OK; Nature intended us to get some sun to produce the essential vitamin D. But benefits diminish and negatives begin to appear after even just 20 minutes during the summer, so be conservative with your sunbathing. 3. Botox Cosmetic or Dysport. [Everyone] has heard about or has used Botox. Dysport is its new competition; practitioners vary in their preference, but dont worry, you cannot go wrong with either. Botox has long-proven its safety and value. For the vertical frown lines between the eyebrows, those horizontal forehead lines and the squint or crows feet just aside the eyes, the injections are terrific. They can also be used to gently lift droopy eyebrows. Yes, they are not permanent, but I see that as a plus. If you dont like the results or dont feel the injections - several times a year - are worth the cost, you can drop out of the program with no negatives. If you like the results and think the cost is worth it, you can continue. Stay tuned. I suspect medical science, which never sleeps, will soon be delivering longer-lasting successors to Botox and Dysport. </p><h3> do we humans have hair glands i popped a ciste i thought and hrs latter my skin was seeping tiny black things </h3><p> Hair grows from follicles, not glands. I'm female, but I've had both acne (in my case it's rosacea) and ingrown hairs. Ingrown hairs are awful; I used to dig my face apart trying to get them out, along with the comedones (blackheads and pimples/cysts). Plus I've had another type of cyst that causes calcifications (like having little pieces of gravel under the skin); generally that's something that happens less in young people and more in people over 50. These hard cysts, when removed, can sometimes be dark in color. The skin makes melanin, the pigment that causes suntans in light-skinned people and that creates skin tone in darker-skinned people. When the glands that produce melanin become blocked by certain cysts, what you're describing can result. My father had a cheek cyst for years that was lanced by a dermatologist and almost exploded. Skin can do some disturbing things. It's the largest organ of the body. However, there is one concern here: the possibility of skin cancer. My father had it repeatedly, my uncle had it, I'm at risk for it, and everybody should look out for it and practice sun safety. People with chronic skin problems that involve the immune system and actual skin damage (which severe lifelong acne does) may be at higher risk for it. Consult a dermatologist, but be prepared: the wait for an appointment is long and some insurances may resist paying for it. A referral from your primary care provider may be necessary. </p><h3> How to treat a burst sebaceous cyst? </h3><p> Sorry you're going through this. Some people are prone to developing , and it's not a pleasant process to go through. If you are not running a fever, you can probably take a wait-and-see attitude toward the situation. (A fever is indicative of an infection, though a localized skin infection may not cause much of a fever.) Drainage is good when it comes to cysts, so you can try applying very warm compresses to the area to help draw out the remaining fluid. The white head you're seeing could be a layer of skin cells re-growing to cover the opening. Although you can gently scrub the skin to keep the cyst open, we generally discourage people from doing this because you don't want to inadvertently introduce infection to the area. Speaking of which, you also can apply antibacterial ointment to the area to reduce the chances of the wound becoming infected. It's not unusual for a large sebaceous cyst to take several days to completely drain after it has burst on its own. Assuming you're not allergic to any over-the-counter pain remedies, you can take ibuprofen or acetaminophen for the pain. If you continue to have concerns about the cyst, or if it emits a smelly, greenish pus, or if you start running a fever, then it's time for a trip to the doctor. It's not necessarily an emergency, but I'd recommend you call your primary health care provider if the situation gets worse or doesn't clear up over the next several days. Wishing you well! </p><h3> is it safe to put wart remover on a skin tag </h3><p> Well, it may not be dangerous, but it won't help either. And you could get a mild skin burn. Warts are caused by a virus. Warts usually resemble hard, rough bumps on the skin. They usually go away on their own after a few months. As you already know, you can use an over-the-counter wart remover to help get rid of them faster. Skin tags, on the other hand, are soft, floppy growths of excess skin cells. They often occur in areas where clothing rubs the skin or where skin rubs against other skin. For example, you might get skin tags around your neck where your shirt collar rubs, or you may get skin tags in your groin area where the skin folds rub together. Because skin tags are not caused by the virus that causes warts, it won't do any good to put wart remover on them. If the skin tags are bothering you, you can ask your health care provider to snip them off. It's a simple, relatively painless procedure. Unless the skin tags are very small, you shouldn't try snipping them off yourself because you could experience excessive bleeding or scarring. Ask your healthcare provider if it's OK for you to snip off your own skin tags before you attempt it yourself. Skin tags can be really annoying! Don't feel embarrassed to talk to your healthcare professional about how to get rid of them the next time you have an office visit. </p>"

Thats true when it comes to sleep, as well. Ive heard from parents whose babies sleep, well, like a baby  through the night  as early as six weeks old. And then there are those parents who still struggle to get a full night of uninterrupted sleep more than a year after their babys birth. What gives? In the first few weeks of life, babies dont have a circadian rhythm going yet which helps them to know the difference between daylight and nighttime. This rhythm, or body clock, starts ticking at around six weeks of age. But whats more critical to the sleep rhythms of infants is their need for nourishment. In other words, its not so much that babies are missing the on and off switch that adults have when it comes to day-and-night cycles. Its that babies cannot hold enough food (i.e., breast milk or formula) in their bellies to get through the night without needing more calories for growth. It takes a baby a few months to grow a belly big enough to accommodate enough calories so they may rest for longer periods without needing to fill up again. And because breast milk, in particular, gets digested more quickly than formula, moms who exclusively breastfeed typically find themselves tending to their tots more frequently than those who are formula-fed. But heres some good news for new parents who worry that they may be doomed to years of sleeplessness: A new study published in the journal Pediatrics and done by researchers from the University of Canterbury, New Zealand, states that by the age of 5 months, over 50 percent of all infants are following their parents sleeping times  and sleeping right through the night. Sound too good to be true? Well, this also means that 50 percent of infants are not following their parents sleeping schedules and are not sleeping through the night. Theres a difference between a baby matching his or her parents sleeping schedule and sleeping through the night. The researchers noted that achieving non-stop sleep does not take that long, but its coinciding with the parents schedule takes longer. For example, a baby who sleeps for six straight hours but does so from 6 pm to midnight, is not going to please most parents who would prefer to go to bed at 10 and get up at 6. But a baby who sleeps for six straight hours from, say 11 p.m. to 5 a.m., may be a lot easier to handle than a baby who has a parent (or both) up in the dead middle of the night. Despite the statistics, sometimes babies just dont comply with whats considered average or normal. And sometimes you just have to stick it out until your baby gets on the same playing field as you. Hopefully thats sooner rather than later. But there are a few things you can try to get your little one to fall into that first 50 percent category  the 50 percent of infants who sleep relatively well through the night. Here they are: * Get a.m. light: Make sure your baby gets a dose of morning light. This will help set the body clock up, and reset a body clock that may be ticking a tad off schedule. * Preserve nap time: Babies nap routinely throughout the day, usually once in the morning, and another in the afternoon. Though you may be tempted to cut back on nap time in order to save sleep time for the night, this will backfire. Babies who get the full extent of their naps in, sleep better than those whose naps are cut short. And they just might grow up smarter, thanks to their naps. * Cluster feed: To overcome the challenge of keeping your babys belly satiated through the night, see if you can feed him in small clusters in the evening hours and then top-off his belly close to bedtime so he goes to sleep with a full belly. That way, he or she is less likely to wake up within a couple of hours hungry. * Try the eat, sleep, play method: We used this method in our house and found it to be extremely helpful. The key here is consistency in the schedule: If it is sleep time and you are out, get home and get them to bed, it will pay off. And for those who try everything and nothing works, consult your pediatrician, there could be reflux (sometimes called colic), or any number of digestive disorders that could be waking your baby. Then be patient. One night, your baby will surprise you. Youll wake up to the sound of nothing and worry that something happened to him or her. As you rush to the crib to check on your little one, you realize that all is well. All are asleep. And so should you be, too. </p><h3> what should be done when after birth the placenta is attached to uterus </h3><p> Get to your local ER NOW! What you are referring to could be a life or death situation. A retained placenta is nothing to play with and if you have delivered at home because you couldn't get to the hospital for whatever reason or you had a home birth with a midwife DO NOT EVEN LISTEN TO THE MIDWIFE, GO TO YOUR PHONE NOW AND DIAL 911! I do not mean to be insulting to the midwifery centers or midwives in general but I do not feel the practice is safe and I have seen two cases of a midwife losing both mother and baby when both would probably still be alive if they had been at the hospital. When something goes wrong during birth it usually happens hard and fast and if you do not have the equipment you need right there and immediately accessible then you can have a tragedy which was completely unnecessary. More and more women are opting for home birth having been told birth is a natural process and yes it is however, the risk is just too high and the consequences too severe to risk even one death which doesn't have to happen. A retained placenta can cause what in the past was called 'childbed fever' where the mother gets a severe uterine infection. There are ways to treat it today however, the risks of hysterectomy, infertility, etc., are very real and again, unnecessary. You can also suffer severe life threatening bleeding from a retained placenta. The only safe treatment in my opinion is in a hospital so please, go! Be well,. Aylagh MacAnnadh, M/D. </p><h3> Is there a problem with my son's baby tooth having a split that the dentist called tooth germination? </h3><p> The proper name is actually Gemination (like Gemini-- twins). It is NOT A PROBLEM. Other children WILL NOT notice this. The only problem is usually with parents! I am a parent myself and I understand your concern, but there is nothing to do at this point and you should just let nature take its course. The baby teeth will fall out and you have to make sure that your child goes to the pediatric dentist for proper care. I strongly recommend a pediatric dentist for your children. [He or she] is the properly trained dentist to handle your children and give them the proper, best experience that will last them a lifetime. </p><h3> When I try and feed my six month old daughter baby food she shakes her head like its sour every time. </h3><p> Maybe she wants some 'real food', like many of the things you are eating. Many babies reject processed baby food (Have you tasted it?), so try preparing some of your own, or start feeding her some safe foods from your plate. She doesn't need teeth for many of those things. Don't give her too many different foods at one time, remember that breast milk or formula is still very important, and follow her pediatrician's recommendation on when to start safe solids, but now may be the time. She watches what you eat, so this may be her way of saying, 'How come if have to eat this stuff in a jar?'' FYI: My daughter did the same thing! </p><h3> If a new born baby test positive for cocaine, does that mean the mother was using throughout her pregnancy? </h3><p> Drug addicts lie. If the baby tested positive, the mother has used cocaine very recently. </p>"
